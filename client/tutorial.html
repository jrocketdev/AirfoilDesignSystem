    Here is your parameter list. This is all 11 of the parameters available for the Pritchard Design. You can edit them in the input boxes and see how the airfoil changes!

<template name="tutorial_step5">
    Here is your airfoil! (With some other bits as well). Let's continue by going over what you can change on here...
</template>

<template name="tutorial_step6">
    <p>BUT! Before we go too far...</p>
    <p>If you make any changes and the airfoil "breaks" (like what's currently shown) that
    means the math does not support the values you've tried. It may take some time to get the hang of what parameters
    are limiting and which are not :-)</p>

    This is the point used to change the Axial Chord. Drag this point left and right to change the value.
</template>

<template name="tutorial_step8">
    Here you can change Tangential Chord by dragging this point up and down.
</template>

<template name="tutorial_step9">
    Move this point to make the Throat Value (O) either larger or smaller. The throat value is represented by the
    length of the red line attached to this point.

<template name="tutorial_step10">
    This point changes the Inlet Angle (B1). It is attached by the leader to the middle of the leading edge circle and
    can be moved around that point to change it's angle.
</template>

<template name="tutorial_step11">
    This point changes the Outlet Angle (B2). It is attached by the leader to the middle of the trailing edge circle and
    can be moved around that point to change it's angle.
</template>

    And that's it! You can consult the paper itself for more information on the math. Enjoy!<br>
